We are creating a war victims management dApp. 
It facilitates crowdfunding to support financially affected war victims and enables them to post their needs, such as medical kits or rescue requests.
As this is a dApp, no opposing army or nation can delete the posts using their cyber teams or manipulate the requests. 
This ensures that no third parties can intrude and affect the needs and aid delivered to the victims. 
We will mainly use the Okto wallet for the crowdfunding feature of our dApp.
